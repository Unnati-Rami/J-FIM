**JFIM — Java File Integrity Monitor.**

**Author:** Unnati Rami.

JFIM (Java File Integrity Monitor) is a command-line security tool designed to detect unauthorized file modifications using cryptographic hashing.

**It provides:**
- File hash verification.
- Snapshot-based integrity checking.
- Real-time monitoring capabilities.

The tool is inspired by integrity monitoring concepts used in Linux security utilities.


**Features:**

**1. Hash Authentication**

Verify the integrity of a file by comparing its current hash with a trusted original hash.

- Automatically detects hash algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512).
- Clearly indicates whether a file is modified or safe.


**2. Snapshot (Integrity Snapshot)**

Create and maintain integrity snapshots of files or directories.

- Stores cryptographic hashes in a snapshot DNA file.
- Recursively scans directories.
- Detects unchanged and modified files.
- Designed for periodic integrity checks.


**3. Real-Time Monitoring**

Continuously monitors files or directories for changes.

- Detects file modifications in near real-time.
- Logs alerts to a persistent log file.
- Runs continuously until manually stopped (Ctrl + C).


**Cybersecurity Relevance:**

JFIM is designed with practical security applications in mind:

- Tamper Detection: Detects unauthorized modifications to system or configuration files.
- Supply Chain Security: Ensures downloaded binaries match the developer’s original hash.
- Incident Response: Provides baseline snapshots to quickly identify altered files during a security breach.

**Installation & Usage:**

**1. For Linux:**
```text
git clone https://github.com/Unnati-Rami/J-FIM.git
cd J-FIM 
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
jfim -h
```

**2. For Windows:**
```text
git clone https://github.com/Unnati-Rami/J-FIM.git
cd J-FIM
jfim.bat -h
```
**NOTE:** After running the installer (Linux) or using the batch file (Windows), all JFIM commands can be executed from anywhere.

**General Syntax:**

```text
jfim <command> [options]
```
**NOTE for Windows Users:** Use jfim.bat instead of jfim.


**Commands:**

```text
-a, --authentication — Verify file hash  
-s, --snapshot — Create or compare integrity snapshot  
-m, --monitor — Real-time file or directory monitoring  
-h, --help — Show help information
``` 


**Options:**

```text
-f <file_path> — Specify a file path  
-p <path> — Specify a file or directory path  
-H <hash> — Provide original hash for verification
```

**Examples:**

Verify a file hash:
```text
jfim -a -f "C:\test\file.txt" -H <original_hash>
```

Create a snapshot of a directory:
```text
jfim -s -p "C:\test\folder"
```

Start real-time monitoring:
```text
jfim -m -p "C:\test\folder"
```

Show help:
```text
jfim -h
```


**Output Style:**

```text
[OK]     File unchanged
[ALERT]  File modified
[ERROR]  Processing error
```

Alerts generated during real-time monitoring are also written to:
logs/alerts.log.txt

**Requirements:**

- Java JDK 17 or later.
- Windows (tested) or Linux.


**Notes:**

- Real-time monitoring runs continuously until stopped manually using Ctrl + C.
- Snapshot and monitor DNA files are created automatically.
- The tool is designed to be simple, transparent, and security-focused.
